    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involved building a comprehensive financial model for <strong>Loblaws Limited</strong> using various advanced financial techniques such as <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong> valuation, <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong>, and <strong>peer comparison</strong> to assess its overall financial health and investment potential. Through this exercise, I gained deeper insights into the company's financial performance and its standing in the retail industry.</p>

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights ðŸŒŸ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DCF Valuation</strong>: Built a DCF model to estimate the company's future cash flows and determine its intrinsic value. This method allowed for assessing the potential returns based on future cash flow projections and discount rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong>: Conducted sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of key financial assumptions (such as growth rates and discount rates) on the company's valuation. This helped assess the risks involved and provided a clearer picture of the financial stability and investment risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Peer Comparison</strong>: Compared Loblaws with industry peers, benchmarking financial metrics like revenue growth, profitability, and market valuation. This comparison provided valuable insights into Loblaws' position within the competitive retail landscape and highlighted areas for growth and improvement.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Financial Modelling</strong>: Utilized advanced DCF and sensitivity analysis techniques to forecast future performance and assess risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>: Leveraged Excel for building complex financial models, conducting calculations, and analyzing data. Used Excel functions to simulate various financial scenarios and stress-test assumptions.</li>
      <li><strong>WACC</strong>: Incorporated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to estimate the company's cost of capital, a crucial element in discounting future cash flows.</li>
